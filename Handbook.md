# Simple Citation Handbook

The Simple Citation System requires 3 pieces of information: author, title of work, and locator to find work.

## Author

If there is one author, write the author's name down in an easily recognizable format. If there are two authors, write down "[first author] and [second author]". If there are more than three authors, write down "[first author] et al.". The author field should be followed by a comma.

## Name of Source

If the source is a large work (e.g. book, film), put the title in italics if possible. If this is not possible, underline the title. If the source is not large, put the title in quotation marks. In both cases, place a comma after the title.

## Locator

If the source is available on the World Wide Web, write down the full URL of the source. Otherwise, if the source is in a book, write down the ISBN. Otherwise, don't bother and remove the comma after the title.

# I'm Still Confused

The official implementation of Simple is in citation_maker.py. The HTML output file is the official citation. Be warned: it is slower than reading this handbook and doing the citations yourself.
